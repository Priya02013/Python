Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations
Problem Statement: Write a Python program that does the following:
1.  Takes two numbers as input from the user.
2.  Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:
o	Addition
o	Subtraction
o	Multiplication
o	Division
3.  Displays the results of each operation on the screen.

Here is the solution :
a=input("Enter the first number: ")
b=input("Enter the second number: ")
Addition= (int(a) +int(b))
print (Addition)
Subtraction= (int(a) - int(b))
print (Subtraction)
Multiplication = (int(a) * int(b))
print (Multiplication)
Division = (int(a)/int(b))
print (Division)
